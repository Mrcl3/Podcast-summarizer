I am Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s. Maybe you know me from my restaurants or maybe from World Central Kitchen, the organization I founded to feed people after disasters. Well, it's time for you to know my podcast, Longer Tables. Each episode I get to know fascinating people in the most intimate way, through food. Stacey Abrams, Jojo Ma, Jane Goodall, Padma Lakshmi. I will answer questions from listeners too. Join me in building Longer Tables, not higher walls, whatever you get your podcasts. This is Blind Plee. I'm your host, Liz Flock. Devon was released from prison on May 23rd, 2023. She's back in Baltimore now, living with her family. And so I gave her a call in early June, less than a month after her release, to talk about how things were going. She told me how hard she's been working to get her life back on track. The reality is, it's not easy. Readjusting has been exhausting. There are a million things to get set up after you leave prison, from getting new IDs to trying to find work. Devon's been applying for lots of jobs. She wants to be fully independent as soon as she can. She's also set up a GoFundMe account to help her get back on her feet. Her goal is to secure a job, get an apartment, put a down payment on a car, and start paying for therapy and her daughter's schooling. Basically, rebuild her life. But I'll let Devon tell you more. Here is an edited version of our conversation. Oh my god, hi. Hi. It's nice to see you. It's nice to see you. How are you feeling? I'm okay. I'm so, I'll show you my bump really quick. I am pregnant. Oh my gosh. It doesn't actually look like that much from there, but it feels like, I feel like a house. Yeah. Yeah, that's going to happen. Definitely. Yeah. How are you feeling? How has today been? It was all right. My stepmom brought me to Pennsylvania. We went to the Dutch market and she took me to the Walmart and stuff like that up there because it's nicer. But yeah, most days I'm just sitting around waiting for my mother to come home. That makes sense. I was trying to imagine you on your first night home. How was it? I remember I talked to you and you got on that flight after they dramatically cut off your ankle monitor. How was it being on the plane and then getting off and seeing everyone? What was that like? It's kind of weird because I didn't let it shock me. I kind of just was like, okay, this is what I have to do. I have to get on this plane. I have to take this trip. Then I have to get off and I have to find these... I have to just get back to life. I still haven't processed anything. I still haven't processed anything because I have to just get back to life. I just feel like right now I don't have time to do that, which I know isn't healthy, but I can't really do anything else about it because I have to get more adjusted to life, more adjusted to my parents. I don't really have time for me and I'm just trying to become independent. That's really the only thing because once I'm independent and once I can completely rely on myself, then I don't need anybody. That's been what I had in my mind even before I left prison. I kept thinking to myself, okay, well, this is what I need to do when I leave. This is what I need to do. I think that that's what's keeping me from processing is my drive that I have for myself that I need to do these things in order to have the things that I want so I can finally be like, okay, well, yeah, I went through this thing and I did this thing and I had to sit down for a while, but I'm okay and look at me now. I'm not broken or anything. I just hurt a little bit, but I'm not broken. What do you feel like you would want people to know about reentry after being in prison or jail? It's more or less like reentry for me personally, reentry is all about yourself. Sometimes you have to be a little selfish when it comes to that, especially if you have kids, because you have to look at the bigger picture. For me, it's like I have to get right and I have to do things for myself. I think mental health is a big deal too. I'm getting Medicaid just so I could go see a mental health doctor. That's my main focus because there's things out here in the world that you don't have to deal with in there. My biggest thing is you get as much as you put into it. You have to want it and you have to help yourself and you can't have too much pride or even shame really. You have to just do what you have to do. Find something, make it your motivation and hold onto it because that's what you need. You need motivation. You mentioned Medicaid. Can you list off all the things you had to do when you got out? Just driver's license, whatever. I've been gone for so long, so I had to start over with everything. I had to file for my social security card, which I did online. I'm waiting on my birth certificate, which Sheila said she found a copy, but I don't know if she's mailed it out yet. That's another thing. Driver's license and then getting Medicaid, it's just paperwork. Everything's online now, but they just ask you a bunch of questions. Then I filed for food stamps because I don't have any income and I want to help my parents out because they've been spending a lot of money on her food and stuff like that. I want to be able to help them give back what they've given her. Just getting an ID, I have to get an ID. I've been waiting on... They need a other identification card, so I have to go soon because my prison one from Tutwiler expires soon. Then you need your social security and then you need two proofs of residency. That's why I said you have to find a motivation. You have to find a reason and you have to want to do it because a lot of this stuff can be discouraging because you feel like it's just so much. I was talking to my friend, Nisha. She was at ATF with me. She was at the Annex with me. She was telling me, she's like, even though we've only been out for a couple of weeks, it feels like we've been out for a year. I know. I feel like I've been out for a long time and I feel like I have done nothing. We were talking about that. That's an anxiety for, I'm sure not just for the both of us. I'm sure that's an anxiety for a lot of people who want to prove that they can do it. You just get out and you're like, I don't have this and I don't have that. It's been almost... They're like, Devon, I've had people tell me it's only been two weeks. My... Simone's had to tell me, Devon, it's only been two weeks. You've only been out. You have to give yourself a break. You need to chill out. I'm like, but it's not fast enough. It's not working. It's not... I need a job. I need this. I need that. It's like, just chill.

It kind of felt like I was never gone in a way, like because she's so, she's my kid, she's my baby, you know? And it was emotional for me because I was like, well, now I get to be mommy again. But at the same time, it was like, okay, well, like I never stopped being mommy. I just wasn't there for a little while. Yeah. Was she like excited to see you or was she just like, whoa, this is crazy? Or like, what was her reaction? Like at first, at night, when I, that night that I like pretty much woke her up, she was kind of like, I think I know you. But like the next day it was kind of, it wasn't really that big of a deal. But as it, as she got more and more used to me now, she's just very, she's like, she's a love bug. Like she'll sit on my lap and she'll, you know, hug me and give me kisses and stuff like that. So yeah, so I think like now that she's recognizing me as mommy, she's way, like she's very affectionate towards me. So. Are you, are you going to eventually try to gain custody? Yes. That's like a process, but really all I have to do is show that I'm independent and I can take care of her independently. And I guess that's why I'm pushing myself so hard because I want to have a job and I want to be able to save up some money. So that way an apartment, you know, I can, I mean, the cost of living here is kind of high, but you know, you can always, you can find the right place. And so I'm going to look for the right place and get us a two bedroom and try to, you know, be on my own. And do you feel like on top of all that, like people have expectations of you? Yeah. I mean, I think I'm the hardest on myself because everyone else is like, you know, well, not everyone, but my stepmom, my aunts, my sister, they're like, you know, you're doing, you're doing really well. You're trying really hard. You're applying to these places. You're, you know, you're gung ho about making a resume, filling out applications. You want to do something. It's not like you're just sitting around and you're just playing on your phone. And on top of that, like I'm still mom and I'm still doing all this other, you know, I'm trying to, you know, get other things set up for myself. And I mean, I really want to write and I really, you know, and I'm, but I was like, I don't have time for that. And it's like, that's it. And that's in my head. You know, I don't have time for that. But as far as pressure, I think that, or expectations, I think that I'm, I'm my worst critic and I think I'm my worst like enemy when it comes to that, because I think that, yeah, they expect me to do things, but they also know where I've been. It's different if you like, you know, you just messed up or you're just not doing what you're supposed to be doing and your parents take you in because you don't have no other place to go. And it's like, well, you have two months or you're, or you're getting kicked out. It's like, no, take your time because we know where you've just come from. And I don't want to take my time. I want to do it. I want everything that I want. I want it right now. So I don't want to wait. Where have you applied? Like what are the, what are the jobs? It's like the grocery store giant, Aldi's, there's like America's Best Value, the little motel hotel thing. There's like a, there's a gas station where they need like a clerk and like places like that. Like I've been trying to just, just to go walking distance, you know, or if I do have to ask for a ride, it's not, but like 10 minutes in the car. So ultimately in terms of jobs, like what do you, cause of course right now you're going to get a job that's close and take your time and settle in, but like down the road, are you still feeling like you want to be an advocate or write a book or be a mechanic or like what's on your mind? Yes, that's what I, I, well, I really, really want to be an advocate and I want to be a writer and my stepmom thinks I should be a public speaker. I don't know about all that. I love to talk about things, but getting out there and actually talking and having people see me like that, that's, that's kind of daunting. But I mean, like I would do it. I would just be really nervous the first few times, but I would love that. Like that's one of my, like that's like a goal. Like I know at first I was all about diesel mechanics and I really wanted to do that because it's something different and I was so interested in it, but now it's like, I feel like I'm kind of tugged more towards being an advocate, being the voice for people talking about things that people don't talk about because people just don't talk about it. They just don't, or they make it seem glamorous and put it in movies that, you know, the woman fights back and she wins and there's no repercussions for fighting back or anything like that. Like it's just like a Jennifer Lopez glamour enough kind of thing. And it's not like that. It's really not. You're, it, when you're in actual domestic violent relationship, like your boyfriend's not just going to be like, okay, you took self-defense classes and now you're, you're going to like whoop on me. Like, no, they're going to, they're going to be way worse than that. So and I want, and I also want the people who are in those relationships or who have been in those relationships to understand that someone is, they're not alone that, or, and then they shouldn't feel like they're less than or that they're stupid because that's what I, I mean, I still kind of kick myself and feel that kind of way. But I just want to make the world more aware of the problem and, and how it ties into so many things. It's not just, it's not black and white at all. It's really not. I know there is a lot of times I could have left or should have left and looking back on it now, I'm like, well, dang, I wish I had, of course. But I don't know. I was just too ashamed to admit that I had messed up and I messed up in a big way. So I kind of let that drive me to stay. Yeah. Shame is like such a powerful emotion. Yeah. Hey, it's me, Sam Bee and it's no secret. I'm pro-choice. Yes, that one, but also others. Cause I'm not just pro-choice. I'm pro-choices. Those crazy life altering decisions that shift our life path and bring us to where we are today. My next choice, starting this new podcast with Lemonada Media called Choice Words, where I interview people I admire about the biggest decisions they've made in their lives. Choice Words is out now, wherever you get your podcasts. Think about a moment in your life that changed you, where one day you were yourself and then the next day, poof, you weren't. I'm Stephanie Whittles-Wax, host of the show Last Day. And each week I sit down with a new guest to explore happy, sad stories of transformation. Some last days are hopeful, some are tragic, but on the other side of every last day is a fresh start. Come laugh, cry with us. Listen to Last Day wherever you get your podcasts. I wanted to ask, have you listened to the podcast at all? Why or why not? I listened to the trailer and I heard my voice on the 911 call and I freaked out and I had a whole cup of bar and I just don't know if I'm ready to do it. Honestly, to hear my own voice and to hear my story like that, I think it'll make it too real. I really do. And right now I just can't. I've desensitized myself so much that if I sit here and I listen to my story and I listen to all the things that I went through and listen to my parents and my aunts and my sister, I think I'll lose my mind. I really do. And I don't want to do that right now. Maybe when I'm established and I can have a breakdown for just a second and not feel like I've completely spiraled out of control, then maybe I will. Yeah, that makes sense. Has anyone else in your friends or family listened and given you feedback? Yeah, I've had one friend who actually was in Shelby County jail with me. She said she listened to it and she really enjoyed it. She said it's crazy to hear you on there because she doesn't know me as this victim kind of person because I've never been that way. She said that she really enjoyed listening to it as far as hearing my story because I don't really break it down for anybody. I just tell people I had a really mean boyfriend and I got tired of him being mean and that's what I tell people. Yeah, are you glad that you participated or how do you feel about it at this point? Oh yeah, I think it was therapeutic for me and I think that it helped me cope while I was locked up and it gave me something to do and to strive for and it also opened up opportunities for me to do what I also want to do, which is advocate and write. I guess public speak. I don't know about that. I don't know about that, but eventually yeah, I would like to do that. I just have to take a confidence boost pill or something. There's got to be something, take some classes on self-confidence I guess. I don't know, but yeah, I'm really glad and I got to meet you and so that's the cherry on top. I can't wait to come to Baltimore as soon as I'm allowed to travel again. Yeah, as soon as I push out this damn baby. One other thing I want to ask you is in the podcast we talk about breaking cycles and the importance of breaking generational cycles of violence and trauma. Do you feel like you're doing that in any way now? The real problem that I know my dad and me and my sister are problem and my mom, there was addiction and I think that that had a lot to do with decisions that I made and decisions that people let me make, if that makes sense. But again, I think that I'm so far away from that mentality now. My whole mentality is different and a has a lot to do with that. But I think my mentality is just so much different now because of the things that I've seen and the things that led me to this point. So I think I would just breaking that curse, I think that I've already done that because I don't even have it in me to put through even a little bit of what I went through when I was her age and then the older she gets, the more I'm going to just be like, no, that's just not how this works. How do you look back on the person you were before when maybe alcoholism was present in your life versus now who you are with a totally different mindset? Well, I just think about the things that I let happen because of alcohol. And I think about all the things that my mom went through, my sister's gone through because of alcohol. And it motivates me to be in the opposite direction. Some people take the bad and make it their purpose for good and some people take the bad and make it an excuse and go ahead and just get into the bad as well. So I think that I'm just on the other side where I'm like, I don't want anything to do with it. I don't. Yeah. Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. I was also thinking about how we've talked a lot about love and how you love love, which I also identify with. What kind of love do you want going forward in the future? I haven't even thought about that. I guess I just want someone to love me and love for who she is because she's a lot of work and she's like, if she's not at school, she's full time. She's full time job. And I guess if they love her and they love me and they accept her and they accept me, then that's good enough for me. For real. Now that I'm out, my mindset's so different that it's kind of like, I'm just like, whatever. I don't know. I still love love and I think love is the greatest thing that there ever was. But at the same time, I just haven't put time into love. I haven't put time into that part of it. So I just want to be independent and be a good person and then I'll worry about love. That's so cool to hear you say because I think, yeah, a lot of us just get caught up in that and then that comes first and then everything else second and then it causes chaos in your life. Yeah, because that's exactly what I did the first time and I don't want to do that again. My family calls it hormones, but it was not hormones. It was love. I was in love with him. So yeah. They just don't understand love like I do. Nobody does except for you if you're in it. Devon has a totally different idea about romantic love after all she's been through. She's focused on making up the years she's lost and ready to be the mom she has wanted to be for the five years she's been away. So, yeah. That's it. I believe our podcast is over, but now I get to talk to you like a normal person. Yeah, absolutely. So that's exciting and I'll be asking you for mom advice. Oh yeah, yeah, I'm excited. I'll be like, how do I change a diaper though? What do I do? One more thing before I go. As we were finishing production on this podcast, we found out about several other cases of women who were arrested in Alabama for killing their alleged abusers. One woman was charged with murder and her case is ongoing. Two other women took plea deals for manslaughter. The injustice doesn't end with Devon and it's a reminder that when we hear stories like this, the reality is often more complicated. It's a reminder to pay attention to anyone who might be struggling with domestic abuse. The more we can keep an eye out for people in our own lives in unhealthy relationships, the more we can prevent tragedies like this from happening. Domestic abuse thrives in the dark and I believe sunlight is the best disinfectant. If you or someone you know is experiencing domestic abuse, use a safe computer and contact the National Domestic Violence Hotline at thehotline.org or call 1-800-799-7233.

The county borders the Bristol Channel to the north, Somerset and Dorset to the east, the English Channel to the south, and Cornwall to the west. Plymouth is the largest settlement. \nThe county has an area of 6,707 km2 (2,590 sq mi) and a population of 1,194,166. The largest settlements after Plymouth (264,695) are the city of Exeter (130,709) and the seaside resorts of Torquay and Paignton, which have a combined population of 115,410. They all are located along the south coast, which is the most populous part of the county; Barnstaple (46,619) and Tiverton (22,291) are the largest towns in the north and centre respectively. For administrative purposes most of Devon is a two-tier county governed by Devon County Council and eight district councils, with the City of Plymouth and Torbay districts forming unitary authorites governed by Plymouth City Council and Torbay Council respectively. \nDevon has a varied and attractive geography; it contains two national parks and parts of five areas of outstanding natural beauty. Dartmoor and a part of Exmoor are within the county. They are the source of most of the county's rivers, including the Taw, Dart, and Exe. The longest river is the Tamar, which forms most of the border with Cornwall and rises in the Devon's northwest hills.  The southeast coast is part of the Jurassic Coast World Heritage Site, and characterised by tall cliffs which reveal the Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous geology of the region. The county gives its name to the Devonian geologic period, which includes the slates and sandstones of the north coast. \nDuring the Iron Age, Roman and the early medieval periods the county was the homeland of the Dumnonii Celtic Britons. The Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain resulted in the partial assimilation of Dumnonia into the kingdom of Wessex during the eighth and ninth centuries, and the western boundary with Cornwall was set at the Tamar by king \u00c6thelstan in 936.", "Devon", ""], "podcast_highlights": "Sure, here are the podcast highlights with timestamps:\n\n0:00 - Introduction by Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s, introducing his podcast \"Longer Tables\" where he interviews fascinating people through food.\n1:30 - Introduction to the Blind Pli podcast by Liz Flock, discussing the challenges of reentry after prison.\n3:36 - Devon talks about the challenges of reentering society, applying for jobs, and getting her life back on track after being released from prison.\n7:20 - Devon discusses her first night home and the process of readjusting to life outside of prison.\n12:56 - Devon talks about the challenges of finding employment and setting up her life after being in prison for so long.\n17:42 - Devon discusses her experience of being a mother and reconnecting with her daughter after being released from prison.\n22:10 - Devon talks about the importance of focusing on herself and her own mental health as she navigates reentry and building a new life.\n24:55 - Devon shares her experiences with the bureaucratic process of getting new identification and applying for benefits like Medicaid and food stamps.\n29:08 - Devon reflects on the pressure and expectations she feels from herself and others to succeed in her reentry journey.\n32:52 - Devon discusses her career goals and aspirations to be an advocate and writer, and her desire to raise awareness about domestic violence and the complexities of abusive relationships.\n37:18 - Devon shares her thoughts on love and her focus on becoming independent and a good parent before pursuing romantic relationships.\n40:01 - Liz Flock wraps up the conversation and reflects on the importance of breaking cycles of violence and trauma.\n\nPlease note that the timestamps provided are approximate and may vary slightly depending on the podcast platform or app you are using."}
